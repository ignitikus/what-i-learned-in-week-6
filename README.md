# What I Learned In Week 6

## While Loops
Loops can execute code until certain condition is met.<br>
For example:

    let i = 0;

    while (i<5){
        code code code code;
        i++;
    } 

At the beginning of this code `i` has value of `0`. At the end of the first run `i` will be bumped by 1 and loop restarts. With each run value of `i` will increase by 1. After reaching 5 the condition of the loop `i<5` is satisfied. Loop stops and the code after the loop will be executed. <br>
Note: `if/else` statements can be used inside of the loop to create additional conditions. <br>
`break` can be used to stop the loop after certain condition within loop is met.

Simple loops with numbers and strings. <br>
Lessons learned:

    Use modulo to check if number is even or odd
    number%2 === 0 ? true : false
